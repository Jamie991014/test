# Group Project Repository

Welcome!

We have added to this repository a `README.md`, `.gitignore`, and `.gitattributes`.

* **README.md**: is the document you are currently reading. It should be replaced with information about your project, and instructions on how to use your code in someone else's local computer.

* **.gitignore**: lets you filter out files that should not be added to git. For example, Windows 10 and Mac OS create hidden system files (e.g., .DS_Store) that are local to your computer and should not be part of the repository. This files should be filtered by the `.gitignore` file. This initial `.gitignore` has  been created to filter local files when using MacOS and Node. Depending on your project make sure you update the `.gitignore` file.  More information about this can be found in this [link](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes/gitignore).

* **.gitattributes**: configures the line ending of files, to ensure consistency across development environments. More information can be found in this [link](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitattributes).

Remember that _"this document"_ can use `different formats` to **highlight** important information. This is just an example of different formating tools available for you. For help with the format you can find a guide [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github).

## General info

This project aims to create an app for ordering snacks from the nearest coffee vendors. The curent version is the deliverable 2 part which is asked to implement routes among customers, snacks and vendors: 

  Each Customer is able to view menu of snacks, details of a specific snack, and start a new order by requesting snacks.
  
  Each Vendor is able to set its location and park status, show the list of all outstanding orders, and mark an order as 'fulfilled'.
  
In order to complete these requirements, our group start to create four parts, "customer", "order", "snack" and "vendor". In details, we separeatly create routes of these four parts for the access, controllers to deal with the data by different functions, models to describe the features needed and one main program file called "server.js".

Inside the customerController, each customer can register their account by entering their family name, given name, email and password, then thier password can be encrypted by using the application "bcryptjs". 

Further, for the ordeController, it can create a new order by each customer and view orders from a specific vendor. 

Moreover, inside the snackController, it can view all snacks menus and the detail of a snack.

Last, for the vendorController, vendors can register by entering the username and password and the password can be encryped by using the application "bcryptjs".

All the features for each part are stored in their corresponding "models.js" and can be accessed through their corresponding routes.

The followings are the variables for customer, vendor, order and snack shown on the Postman, which is used the URL link from heroku. While the URL link in the comment in code is the one with "localhost".

In this stage, we completed the login page for Customers and once they have been login. There is a map to indicate the location of the user and the nearest five vendors.

## Notice for location setting of our vendors 
As most locations of our vendors are based around University of Melbourne, you might need to drag your map (zoom out) to the area of university in order to find out our vendors. 

They could first view menu of snacks which includes the corresponidng image, price and descirption after selecting one vendor. At the login page, they could choose to skip login, while they have to login again in order to start their orders. 

## Notice for presentation of menu
Those images on the page is just for presentation which means that they cannot be pressed. Also, the page header "Home" and "My account" are just for representation, please do not press on them ~

For create a new order of different snacks, they can select quantities and press the button "sumbit" below and then the information of this order should be placed inside the "All orders" which includes the id of vendor they ordered from, a list of snacks they wanted and their order id.
View menu of snacks (including pictures and prices)
